# aero

(<b>a</b>ero is <b>e</b>dn <b>r</b>eally, <b>o</b>k?)

Light and fluffy configuration.

![Light and fluffy configuration](aero.jpg)

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file

```clojure
[aero "0.1.2"]
```

## Status

Please note that being a 0.x.y version indicates the provisional status
of this library, and that features are subject to change.

## Getting started

Create a file called `config.edn` containing the following

```clojure
{:greeting "World!"}
```

In your code, read the configuration like this

```clojure
(require '[aero.core :refer (read-config)])
(read-config "config.edn")
```

## Design goals

### Explicit and intentional

Configuration should be explicit, obvious, not clever. It should be easy to understand what the config is, and where it is declared.

Determining config while diagnosing a support issue should not be a
[wild goose chase](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wild-goose_chase).

### Avoid duplication ...

Config files are often duplicated on a per-environment basis, attracting all the problems associated with duplication.

### ... but allow for difference

When looking at a config file, a reader will usually ask: "Does the value differ from the default, and if so how?". It's clearly better to answer that question in-place.

### Allow config to be stored in the repository ...

When config is left out of source code control it festers and diverges from the code base. Better to keep a single config file in source code control.

### ... while hiding passwords

While it is good to keep config in source code control, it is important to ensure passwords and other sensitive information remain hidden.

### Config should be data

While it can be very flexible to have 'clever' configuration 'programs',
it can be
[unsafe](http://www.learningclojure.com/2013/02/clojures-reader-is-unsafe.html),
lead to exploits and compromise security. Configuration is a key input
to a program. Always use data for configuration and
[avoid turing-complete](http://langsec.org/occupy) languages!

### Use environment variables sparingly

We suggest using environment variables sparingly, the way Unix intends,
and not [go mad](http://12factor.net/config). After all, we want to keep configuration explicit and intentional.

Also, see these arguments [against](https://gist.github.com/telent/9742059).

### Use edn

Fortunately, most of the tech to read configuration in a safe, secure
and extensible way already exists in the Clojure core library (EDN).

## Tag literals

Aero provides a small library of tag literals.

### env

Use `#env` to reference an environment variable.

```clojure
{:password #env DATABASE_PASSWORD}
```

When you need to hide a configuration detail, such as a password, use
this feature. If you're using AWS Beanstalk, you can set environment
variables in the console, which keeps them safe from unauthorised
access.

Use `#env` with a vector to provide a default if the environment variable doesn't exist.

```clojure
{:password #env [PORT 8080]}
```

### cond

Use cond as a kind of reader conditional.

`#cond` expects a map, from which is extracts the entry corresponding to the of __profile__.

```clojure
{:webserver
  {:port #cond {:default 8000
                :dev 8001
                :test 8002}}}
```

You can specify the value of __profile__ when you read the config.

```clojure
(read-config "config.edn" {:profile :dev})
```

which will return

```clojure
{:webserver
  {:port 8001}}
```

### hostname

Use when config has to differ from host to host, using the hostname. You
can specify multiple hostnames in a set.

```clojure
{:webserver
  {:port #hostname {"stone" 8080
                    #{"emerald" "diamond"} 8081
                    :default 8082}}}
```

## References

Aero is built on Clojure's [edn](https://github.com/edn-format/edn).

Aero is influenced by [nomad](https://github.com/james-henderson/nomad),
but purposely avoids instance, environment and private config.
